A word of advice for AI experts.

I see so many people on LinkedIn changing their profiles to AI experts overnight. While this seems like a positive move to increase employability, many people can see through the profile when it becomes increasingly obvious that the timelines don't match especially when you have a PhD.

This creates a credibility gap that undermines the very goal of rebranding. Employers and colleagues who notice the discrepancy between your claimed expertise and your actual work history will question not just your AI credentials, but your overall honesty and integrity.

The authenticity of your professional narrative matters more than you might think. A genuine journey into AI expertise, even if recent, told honestly is far more compelling than an overnight transformation that doesn't align with your documented experience.

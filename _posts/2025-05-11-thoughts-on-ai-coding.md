excerpt: "Some thoughts on AI coding tools and what might be a decent mental model for what's coming."

If you've been involved in any level with the tech industry over the last 3 years, you would have an idea of the AI coding tools that are in the market such as Claude Code, VsCode with Copilot, Cursor not to mention many smaller players such as Cline and Roo.

Like with any argument these days we are seeing strong polarisation of views with one side claiming there is no more of a need for software developers and the other side saying these are just a gimmick and don't add any productivity whatsoever. The latter group also seems to claim that if AI tools are increasing your productivity then you must be a subpar developer that wasn't all that competitive anyway.

As with any argument 


Where it's useful
Where it's not useful
Rate of adoption
Is it really going to kill offshore?
Why is the managerial class so much pro AI?

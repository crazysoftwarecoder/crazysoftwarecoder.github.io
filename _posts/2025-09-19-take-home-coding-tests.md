Take-home coding tests spark endless debate. Useful evaluation, or just noise?

This is just my lens from years of doing these.

## The Subjectivity Problem

Subjectivity is real. Reviewers judge patterns, naming, layering style, component choices, file structure, even commit hygiene. Two strong engineers can read the same code and disagree. That doesn't make either wrong, it just means the assessment surface is huge and taste driven.

## Do It If It's Genuinely Interesting

If the ask is genuinely interesting, do it. A cool problem, a domain you want to learn, a project you would have built anyway. In that case, you win even if you don't get the offer, because the artifact is reusable and the learning compounds.

A few months ago, I had a take home to stream and process financial transactions from a spark stream into yugabyte and write performance tests for the entire infrastructure all running on docker. This was a lot of fun to write just for the learning and understanding how yugabyte was deployed locally vs at scale.

## Treat It as a Learning Sprint

Treat it as a learning sprint, not a ticket to success. The only dependable return is what you learn: a new library, a better packaging pattern, a stronger README narrative. Offers are influenced by timing, fit, and reviewer taste. These are things that are tough for the candidate to control with certainty. Do the work for you.

## The LeetCode Comparison

Many have reservations against the leetcode industrial complex. Yes, LC is harder as a result of its divergence from the day to day and the tremendous upfront investment thereof, but at least it is measurable. You either reach the solution with the most optimal time and space complexity or you don't. You either pass all the test cases or you don't. There is lesser room for subjectivity in a LC test.

## The Trade-off Storytelling Challenge

With take-homes there is no such single outcome. You are scored on choices and trade-off storytelling as much as code. All of these change based on what your reviewers have gone throughout their experience.

This creates a fundamentally different evaluation surface where technical correctness is just one dimension among many. Your architectural decisions, documentation quality, testing approach, and even git commit messages become part of the assessment. While this might better reflect real-world software development, it also introduces significant variance in how different reviewers interpret the same submission.

Hi there and welcome to my website!

I'm Ashwanth (pronounced as "ash-wun-th"), a software engineer with a passion for building large scale distributed systems. I've worked in some of the most iconic companies in the world like Apple, Canva, Atlassian, eBay and Walmart. 

Over the years, I've continuously honed my skills in building internet scale systems, learning from brilliant co-workers in the industry and helping those around me grow their skills through mentorship.

I've worked across many different layers in the backend from RPC services, database migrations, cloud infrastructure, load balancers, caching, observability and more.

Enjoy reading my random ramblings and ruminations and feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwanthf/) or [Twitter](https://x.com/ashwanthf).
